Using-Dalle-A-2-and-Chat-GPT-2-to-Generate-Images

Greetings to all visitors on my page! I am an enthusiastic high school student, captivated by the intriguing world of programming and artificial intelligence. In my quest to explore the realm of AI, I've embarked on crafting four diverse Python scripts. These scripts represent a broad spectrum of functionality, from fostering engaging conversations to birthing stunning visual images straight from textual descriptions.
It's worth noting that the complexity of these scripts owes its existence to the wisdom shared through OpenAI's documentation and various insightful YouTube videos. As such, the originality of the code doesn't entirely belong to me. Instead, think of it as a harmonious symphony of scripts curated from the internet, meticulously assembled to facilitate a seamless user experience. Welcome aboard, and enjoy the journey of AI exploration!

ChatGPT+ImageGenator.py
This application is a splendid illustration of the principle of collaborative intelligence, incorporating elements derived from OpenAI's official documentation and educational YouTube videos. It is tailored to enable users to translate textual descriptions into vibrant visualizations, employing an efficient workflow involving OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model and the DALL-E-2 model with the g64 plugin.
Upon receiving a user's textual description, the application first leverages the language processing capabilities of GPT-3.5-turbo. This AI model amplifies the input description, enhancing it for optimal detail and clarity. The enriched description then serves as a prompt for the DALL-E-2 image creation module, which further harnesses the power of the g64 plugin to generate an image that encapsulates the essence of the user's concept.
Furthermore, the application comes equipped with the ability to create variations of the generated image, giving users the freedom to explore different visual interpretations of their initial idea. If the generated image doesn't align with the user's vision, they can command the program to create alternative renditions. This functionality fosters a cyclical process of creative generation that can be invoked continuously, until the user explicitly chooses to cease, making this application a flexible and engaging platform for the conversion of textual descriptions into unique visual content.

ConversationChatGPTwithGUI.py
Credit for the original code goes to a tutorial available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGOyw_M1mNE&t=631s&ab_channel=TheAIAdvantage. In this script, I've made some alterations to better suit our needs.
This script serves as the foundation for an interactive chat interface, powered by Gradio, which enables engaging dialogues with the GPT-3.5-turbo model. Simulating a conversation with a financial expert adept in real estate investment and negotiation, the user introduces text that's integrated into the system and user conversation history. This is forwarded to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to elicit a relevant assistant message, enriching the conversation history. The assistant's response, mirrored on the Gradio interface, propels the conversation, thereby creating a dynamic, interactive chat experience for the user.

ImageGenerator.py
Taking inspiration from both YouTube videos and documentation, I have successfully merged various parts to form a cohesive and functional code. The original tutorial can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1-7KMHWju4&t=926s&ab_channel=ParametricCamp.This script employs the potency of OpenAI's API, translating user-given descriptions into visual realities. The class ImageGenerator defines two methods. The CreateImage method interprets the user's description and communicates it to OpenAI's Image model, culminating in the generation of an image corresponding to the given description. This image is stored in the same directory as the script. The Change method empowers the user to introduce a new description, stimulating the generation of fresh images. The user can specify the number of iterations for the script, thereby allowing the generation of numerous images in a single session.

NonConversationChatGPT.py
Following the same approach, this code is a product of combining snippets from various resources, including OpenAI documentation and YouTube tutorials.
The script collaborates with OpenAI's DaVinci engine to augment user-provided descriptions. Within the NoChatIncluded class, two methods are defined. The get_description method prompts the user to furnish a description, and the enhance_description method capitalizes on this by deploying OpenAI's DaVinci engine to generate an enhanced, more articulate version. The enriched description is then ideal for subsequent image generation. This code is not conversation assissant. Once you put in the description you want ChatGPT DaVinci to enhance, it will print the enhanced description in the terminal. The code is then done.
